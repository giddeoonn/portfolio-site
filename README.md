Personal Portfolio Website (Early Phase)

This is my personal portfolio website. It's currently a work in progress and still in its early development stage.  
The goal is to eventually showcase my projects, skills, and contact information in one place.

🔧 Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

🚧 Current Status
- ❌ No mobile/tablet responsiveness yet  
- ❌ No project entries yet  
- ✅ Desktop version layout in progress  
- ✅ Basic navigation and sections started

💡 Goals
- Make the layout fully responsive across devices  
- Add real projects and interactive sections  
- Host it live using GitHub Pages

📌 Why I'm Building This
This project helps me practice front-end web development and track my growth. I'm still improving my skills in JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, and I plan to update this site as I learn more.
